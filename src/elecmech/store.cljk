  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7412 Electrical Mechanics and Fitters service
  scheduling/logistics coordination actor (itonami actor pattern,
  ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's 'Robotics
  premise' — a service scheduling/logistics coordination robot
  performs service-call scheduling, service-call/parts-usage/
  diagnostic-status record logging and electrical-parts supply-order
  coordination for an electrical mechanic/fitter crew under this
  advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches hardware itself, never
  performs electrical-repair work itself, and never finalizes an
  electrical-repair-execution decision, a lockout/tagout-clearance
  decision, or overrides an electrical safety officer's judgment —
  those remain a certified electrical safety officer's exclusive
  judgment). Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7127's hvacmech.store
  (closest domain shape — same physical-safety-domain, certification-
  gated technician-safety pattern — itself modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7111's housebuilder.store, cloud-itonami-isco-3313's
  accountingsupport.store and cloud-itonami-isco-9311's
  mininglabor.store for the physical-safety-domain shape).

  Domain:

    technician      — a registered electrical mechanic/fitter
                       {:technician-id :name :certified?}. `:certified?`
                       is informational registered data (the
                       technician's certification status as recorded
                       at registration time) — the governor's
                       provenance check only requires the technician
                       record to exist (independently verified/
                       registered before any action); it never lets a
                       proposal override or bypass the certification
                       requirement itself, and never lets a proposal
                       override an electrical safety officer's
                       judgment (see elecmech.governor's
                       scope-excluded-action rule).
    service-account — a registered service account/site {:service-account-id
                       :name :max-supply-cost number}. `:max-supply-cost`
                       is an informational registered ceiling used only to
                       decide whether a `:coordinate-supply-order`
                       proposal escalates to human sign-off (the governor
                       never blocks a within-threshold order outright; it
                       only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record           — a committed operating record (a logged
                       service-call/parts-usage/diagnostic-status entry, a
                       scheduled service operation, a flagged safety
                       concern, or a coordinated supply order) — written
                       ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger           — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
